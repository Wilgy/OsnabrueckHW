% ziplists3.pl - Prolog file for HW03, Task 3
% Defines a predicate that checks the contents of two lists and compares
% them to the contents of a third in various ways

/*
Define a predicate:

   zip_lists3(L, L1, L2)

- L1 and L2 contain together all elements of L,
  but L1 contains (at least) three times as many elements as L2.
  ( |L2| * 3 >= |L1| )

- the sequential order should be maintained

- every fourth element of L should be in L2
 

Examples:
   zip_lists3([1,2,3,4],[1,2,3],[4]).
     yes
   zip_lists3([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,5],[4]).
     yes
   zip_lists3([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[1,2,3,5,6,7],[4,8]).
     yes
   zip_lists3([],[],[]).
     yes

Order should be maintained!

   zip_lists3([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[7,6,5,3,2,1],[4,8]).
     no

Try:
   zip_lists3(L,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[a,b]).
and
   zip_lists3(L,L1,L2).

Hint:
You must also consider all cases where the number of elements in L
cannot be divided by 4 without a remainder!

% zip_list(-L, +L1, +L2) - given two lists, 'zips' the contents of both lists
% and puts the result in a final list; EXCEPT it grabs three elements from the
% first list and then one element from the second list
%
% -L : The resulting zip list
% +L1 : The first list (grabbing three elements at a time)
% +L2 : The second list (grabbing one element at a time)
%%
zip_lists3(L, L1, L2 ) :-
    zip_list_left(L, L1, L2).

% Base case: If there are any elements left in L1, concatenate them to the 
% end of the result list (does not matter how any elements are left)
zip_list_left(L, L, []).

% Recursive call: Can only grab three elements at a time from L1 if it 
% cannot and there are still elements in L2, then fail
zip_list_left([H11, H12, H13 |R],  [H11, H12, H13 |R1], [H2|R2]) :-
    zip_list_right(R, R1, [H2|R2]).

% Base case: If there is nothing left in L1, there should be nothing left in L2
zip_list_right(_L, [], []).

% Recursive case: Pull one element from L2 and add it to the result list
zip_list_right([H2|R], L1, [H2|R2]) :-
    zip_list_left(R, L1, R2).
