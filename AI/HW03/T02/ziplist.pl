/*
Define a predicate:

   zip_list(L,L1,L2)

L is a list containing all elements from L1 and L2.
The first element of L should be the first of L1 ,
the second of L should be the first of L2,
the third of L should be the second of L1,
etc.
Example:
   zip_list(L,[1,2,3],[a,b,c]).
       L=[1, a, 2, b, 3, c]

L1 and L2 need not be of equal length.
If 'zip_list' is called with uninstantiated L,
the elements of the longer list of L1 and L2 should all be present in L.
This affects calls with L instantiated.
Which?

Examples:
   zip_list(L,[1,2,3],[a,b,c,d]).
       L=[1, a, 2, b, 3, c, d]
   zip_list(L,[1,2,3,4,5],[a,b,c]).
       L=[1, a, 2, b, 3, c, 4, 5]
   zip_list([1,2,1,2,1,2],[1,1,1],L).
       L=[2, 2, 2]


Hints:
Use two predicates which call each other alternately.
If one of L1 or L2 is empty, return the other.
Else add the element to L and call the other predicate.

To see the problems with instantiated first argument, try:

      zip_list([1,2,3,4,5],X,Y)

and discuss the result
