 Consider the following family tree and formulate the
 information contained in that tree as prolog facts.

/*
 Think about how information concerning gender can
 be represented with minimal redundancy.
 Hint: to state both father(kronos,poseidon) and male(kronos)
 as facts in the program is redundant, because
 male(kronos) is derivable from father(kronos,poseidon)

 Use predicate names from the set: {father, mother, parent, male, female}

Pose at least these queries:
 - Who is the mother of whom?
 - Which are the children of Zeus?
 - Do Hades and Zeus have both the same father?
 - Which Individuals have common children?
 - Which men have more than one child?
 - Who has no ancestor (in this family tree)?

Add the queries and answers as arguments of the following predicate.

% Rule added to handle the example query
% Determines if M is the mother of C
mother(M, C) :- female(M), parent(M, C).

% Determines is F is the father of the C
father(F, C) :- male(F), parent(F, C).

% example
query(                           
   'Who is the mother of whom?',

                                 % if there is no answer enter 'false' here

% To solve this query, the father rule was created above, and calls it with 
% the 'zeus' symbol as the father variable; The only solution is the 'hebe'
% symbol
query(
   'Which are the children of Zeus?',
   (father(zeus, C)) ,
   (C=hebe) ).  

% This query will return true when the X variable unifies with the 'kronos'
% symbol
query(
   'Do Hades and Zeus have both the same father?',
   (father(X, hades)) ,
   (father(X, zeus)) ,
   (X=kronos) ).

% Given two unique symbols, X and Y, this query returns true when they both
% have the same child symbol C at least once;  This returns true for the pairs
% (kronos, rhea), (zeus, hera), and (poseidon, amphitrite)
query(
   'Which Individuals have common children?',
   (parent(X, C)) ,
   (parent(Y, C)) , 
   (X\=Y) ,
   (X=kronos, Y=rhea;
    X=zeus, Y=hera;
    X=poseidon, Y=amphitrite) ).

% This query will return true when a father symbol X has two unique child
% symbols C1 and C2; This is true for X=kronos and X=poseidon
query(
   'Which men have more than one child?',
   (father(X, C1)) ,
   (father(X, C2)) ,
   (C1\=C2) ,
   (X=kronos;
    X=poseidon) ).  

% This returns true when a parent symbol P cannot be proven to exist for a 
% given X variable; this is true for kronos and rhea
query(
   'Who has no ancestor?',
